Shape Drawer AI with Python Turtle Graphics

Overview

Shape Drawer AI is a Python-based application that leverages the built-in turtle graphics module to dynamically draw a wide range of shapes. The program accepts user input for a shape name and then renders the corresponding drawing in a dedicated graphics window. In addition to common geometric shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, the application also features more complex designs such as stars, spirals, and fractal trees, showcasing recursive drawing techniques.

Features
	•	Interactive Shape Selection: Users can input the name of a shape (e.g., circle, square, triangle) to trigger its drawing.
	•	Basic Shapes: Includes implementations for drawing circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, pentagons, and hexagons.
	•	Advanced Shapes: Offers additional drawings for stars, spirals, and a recursive fractal tree.
	•	Real-Time Visualization: Utilizes Python’s turtle module to provide immediate visual feedback during drawing.
	•	Customizable Parameters: Easily adjust dimensions and angles within the code to modify the appearance of shapes.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.x (Python’s turtle module is included with most distributions)

Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shape-drawer-ai.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd shape-drawer-ai

Running the Application

Execute the Python script to launch the interactive shape drawer:

python shape_drawer_ai.py

When prompted, enter one of the supported shape names (e.g., circle, square, fractal_tree) to see the corresponding drawing.

Usage

Upon running the application, the program will display a prompt in the terminal. Enter the name of a shape from the following list:
	•	circle
	•	square
	•	rectangle
	•	triangle
	•	pentagon
	•	hexagon
	•	star
	•	spiral
	•	fractal_tree

The selected shape will then be drawn in the turtle graphics window.
